# Biometric_F19
In this project, you will work with your group members to develop a face recognition system thatwill be tested on the images captured from the team. From the folder FaceData, I havepreprocessed the images with a face detector. As you know, some of the images exhibit morevariation compared to others in factors such as lighting, pose, facial expressions, distance fromthe camera, and occlusions. You have three goals for this project:  (<-- two spaces)
1.Build a face recognition system. (<-- two spaces)
2.Analyze the system against images with varying amounts of intra-class variation. (<-- two spaces)
3.Describe the performance of the system. (<-- two spaces)
